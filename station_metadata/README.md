# Weather Station Metadata

These files have been provided by the USA's NOAA and extracted on 21 June 2021.

The starting point for all such land data is located
at the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data).

The [weather stations metadata](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/station-metadata) provides the path to the [Historical Observing Metadata Repository](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/homr/reports) (HOMR). 

## Station Locations

The file [*Enhanced MSHR Lite*](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/homr/file/emshr_lite.txt;jsessionid=C58732861437B2AD08BA6607F0C3A2D5) seems to be sufficient for the exercise of mapping weather stations, as it contains latitude and longitude properties for each station.

The full files are too large to be accepted by github.com.
Truncated files only will be committed and used for testing.
